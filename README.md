Inline Integrity
================

Based on a discussion at [WICG/signature-based-sri#10](https://github.com/WICG/signature-based-sri/issues/10#issuecomment-2594904400),
this repository sketches out what an inline integrity assertion might look like, and why one might want such a thing. Once the sketch
looks reasonable, I'll come back to flesh out this explainer (through the magic of copy/paste!) and circulate it a bit for discussion.
